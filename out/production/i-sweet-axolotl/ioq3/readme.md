## Building:
I would recommand building on Linux. <br>
### Build for Linux on Linux:
Make sure you have SDL2 development installed. <br>
Then run ``make`` in the ioq3 directory. <br>
### Building for Windows on Linux:
Install mingw-w64. <br>
Enter the ioq3 directory. <br>
Build for x86: ``make PLATFORM=mingw32 ARCH=x86`` <br>
Build for x86_64: ``make PLATFORM=mingw32 ARCH=x86_64`` <br>
